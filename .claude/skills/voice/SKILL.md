# Voice: postures over a layered stack

Drafting into an existing conversation: read it first. Greeting, sign-off, one block or a stream, and the sender's own unanswered questions come from the thread, not from the request.

1. Pick the register. Relational (email, Slack, WhatsApp, DMs, a comment or reply under a social post: a person answers): `personal-voice.md` wins conflicts. Authored (articles, LinkedIn posts, proposals, slides, docs: an audience reads): `prose-style.md` wins on sentence mechanics. A comment answers a person, so it is relational however public the thread is.
2. Name the posture. Relational prose always has one: read `postures.md` before writing a word. Authored prose has no posture and takes a scaffold overlay instead.
3. Apply the four base layers in order, then the overlays the situation calls for.
4. Conflicts: the posture beats every layer on length, openings, closings and directness. Layers beat the posture on everything else. Channel mechanics beat both where they carve out.

## The primary axis

`postures.md`: the nine measured situational registers of relational prose (quick reply, decision/pushback, delegation/ask, repair, teaching, scheduling, intro, status update, LinkedIn DM). Length, opening and closing moves, directness, verbatim phrasings.

## The four base layers, in order

Layers 1-3 are positive: write from them. Layer 4 is a filter: check the draft against it.

| Layer | File | Owns |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 Brand | `brand-voice.md` | h&w as a company: positioning terms, KPIs, banned words, numbers, banned Unicode, client naming, sender identity |
| 2 Personal voice | `personal-voice.md` | The one shared voice of everyone who writes under their own name: greeting and sign-off, the measured numbers, hedges and particles, emoji, anti-patterns |
| 3 Prose | `prose-style.md` | Sentence mechanics (DE/EN), language choice, German orthography |
| 4 AI-tells filter | `ai-tells.md` | Structures, openers, transitions, copula dodges and the measured signature vocabulary that mark prose as LLM output. The vocabulary check is a density bar, not a word ban |

## Overlays, when the channel or situation matches

| File | When | Owns |
|------|------|------|
| `slack-channel.md` | Slack via the MCP tool | Markdown quirks and Slack-only conventions |
| `content-formula.md` | Post-length content: LinkedIn essays, blog articles, talk arcs | Six beats, the research-backed pattern |
| `negotiation.md` | Pricing pushback, advisor or partner setup, speaker fees, training scope, scope creep, asking for visibility, intros or access | Tactics and h&w-specific phrasings |
| `intro-framework.md` | 30-second self-introduction | NSFAG: Name, Same, Fame, Aim, Game |

A cold pitch, a proposal opener or speaker outreach takes its shape from `postures.md`, "Pitch and positioning".

## Reference, for deep calibration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `signature-phrases.md` | The user's measured calibration anchors, how to pull real email exemplars from his mailbox, and his spoken slogan catalogue. Use when ghostwriting from a transcript or anchoring a draft that needs more voice depth than `personal-voice.md` gives |
| `brand-vocabulary.md` | Verbatim offerings and value props, written positioning vocabulary, the competitive frame, approved performance language. Use when positioning in proposals or sales decks, or citing numbers |
