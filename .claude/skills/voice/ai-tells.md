# AI tells

A detector list, not a positive rule. Run the draft against it after the four base layers, asking
of each paragraph: "would a reader looking for AI output flag this?" Rewrite anything that triggers
without the offending pattern, not around it. DE and EN both; bans apply regardless of punctuation
or surface variation.

## 1. Structural patterns

These shape sentences, not word choice, so they survive paraphrasing.

### Contrastive reframe ("not just X, it's Y")

| Banned | Use instead |
|--------|-------------|
| "It's not just X, it's Y" / "It's not X, it's Y" | name Y directly |
| "We don't just X, we Y" | "We Y" |
| "Not a trend, an epidemic" / "Not a tool, a partner" | the concrete claim without the contrast frame |
| "X isn't evolving, it's accelerating" (any pivot punctuation) | same rule, banned in all forms |
| DE: "Nicht nur X, sondern Y" / "Das ist kein X, das ist ein Y" | nenn Y direkt |

### Negative parallelism ("no X, no Y, just Z")

"No fluff, no jargon, just results" / "Not slower, not cheaper, but smarter" / DE "Kein X, kein Y,
sondern Z": drop the triplet, make one concrete claim.

### Rule of three (forced triplets)

Triplet adjectives, noun phrases or parallel clauses applied regardless of necessity: "fast,
reliable, and secure" / "build, measure, learn" / "clarity, speed, focus". Pick the one that
matters and cut the rest. If three concepts belong, vary clause length so it does not read as a
triplet.

### Aphorism stacking

Short declaratives in a row, each pretending to be wisdom: "Clarity is speed. Less is more. The
simplest version wins." One concrete observation tied to a specific situation instead.

### Announced count

"Three things I'd push on." / "Two things to note:" / "A few thoughts:" / "Here are some reasons:"
/ DE "Drei Dinge dazu:" / "Zwei Punkte:": drop the preamble and state the first point. A count the
argument depends on ("only two of the five survive") stays.

### Soft-challenge verbs

"Things I'd push on" / "One thing I'd push back on" / "I'd poke at this" / "worth pressing on" /
DE "Hier würde ich nachhaken" / "Daran würde ich rütteln": name the disagreement directly. "Two of
these contradict each other." "This is wrong because..."

### Elegant variation

Swapping synonyms for the same referent ("Yankilevsky... the non-conformist artist... their
creative output..."). Repeat the noun. Plain repetition reads as confident.

### Generic temporal or landscape opener

"In today's fast-paced landscape..." / "In a world where..." / "Right now, X is changing faster
than..." / DE "In der heutigen Zeit..." / "In einer Welt, in der...": drop the frame, open on the
concrete situation.

### The four-beat paragraph

1. Opening: framing claim or landscape statement
2. Expansion: elaboration or supporting evidence
3. Contrast: reframe or tension signal (but / however / it's not just)
4. Resolution: takeaway, imperative, or call to action

A paragraph that follows this skeleton end-to-end reads as AI regardless of the words. Cut the
opening landscape claim and start at the expansion. Remove the contrast pivot; the claim stands
without it. Cut the closing imperative unless it names a specific next step.

## 2. Opener and hook patterns

Banned in all forms:

| Pattern | Banned example | Use instead |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Curiosity hook | "Have you ever wondered..." | name the actual question |
| Candor opener | "Let's be honest..." | be honest without announcing it |
| Reveal setup | "Here's the thing..." | state the thing |
| Rhetorical-question challenge | "What if the way we think about X is wrong?" | make the claim directly |
| Contrarian opener | "Most people believe X. They're wrong." | argue the position without the binary |
| Statistic opener | "Studies show that X percent of teams..." | name the study; cite once, in body |
| Empathy opener | "If you've ever struggled with..." | open on a concrete moment |
| Direct imperative pair | "Stop doing X. Start doing Y." | argue the change instead of commanding it |
| Confession opener | "I used to think X. I was wrong." | tell the actual story, including the change |
| Urgency frame | "The window for X is closing." | name the deadline or cut the urgency |
| Paradox opener | "The more you try to X, the less Y you get." | drop the paradox framing |
| Community segmentation | "Whether you're a founder, a marketer, or a..." | address one audience at a time |

## 3. Transition and bridge fillers

| Category | Banned | Use instead |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Summary | "at the end of the day", "in a nutshell", "ultimately" | drop the bridge |
| Restatement | "in other words", "the reality is", "to be clear" | the first version was wrong, rewrite it |
| Topic-pivot | "at its core", "when it comes to" | name the topic directly |
| Contrast | "on the other hand", "that said", "at the same time" | "but" or a period |
| Hedge | "it's worth noting", "needless to say", "moving forward" | if it's worth noting, note it |
| DE | "letzten Endes", "im Grunde", "im Kern", "in der Tat", "nichtsdestotrotz" | dieselbe Regel |

## 4. Copula and verb dodging

LLMs avoid plain "is" and "has".

| Banned | Use instead |
|--------|-------------|
| "X serves as a Y" / "X stands as a Y" / "X represents a Y" / "X marks a Y" | "X is a Y" |
| "X features Y" / "X offers Y" / "X boasts Y" | "X has Y" |
| DE: "X fungiert als Y", "X stellt ein Y dar" | "X ist ein Y" |

## 5. Formatting tics

Sentence case in headings. Bold sparingly, never as a substitute for a heading. No "**Term:**
description" repeated as a list; full sentences, or a real two-column table where the items are
parallel.

## 6. Signature vocabulary

Measured, not guessed. `github.com/louisabraham/load-bearing` groups 461,121 GitHub pull-request
descriptions into ten clusters by vocabulary alone, and its author reads one of them as Claude. The
classes below are that cluster's own.

A ratio is not a ban. Most of these are ordinary English and sometimes the right word. What marks
the text is density: the cluster reaches for a stance adverb, an absolute, and a verdict verb inside
one paragraph, and a person writing to a deadline does not. Across our own published LinkedIn posts:
`nobody` 91, `carries` 84, `deliberately` 72, `nothing` 52, `honestly` 23.

The bar: at most two of these words in one piece, and never two of the same class in one
paragraph. Past that, rewrite the sentence carrying the third.

The classes: stance adverbs (`plainly`, `quietly`, `genuinely`, `deliberately`, `merely`,
`precisely`, `honestly`, `silently`); absolutes (6b); the abstraction that acts (6c); courtroom
nouns (`refusal`, `premise`, `defect`, `precedent`, `remedy`, `verdict`, `caveat`: a `defect` in a
client mail about software is a bug, a `remedy` is a fix); coined compounds (`load-bearing`,
`chokepoint`, `backstop`, `tripwire`, `lever`, `seam`) and the hyphenated `re-` verb
(`re-verified`, `re-derived`: "checked again"). DE: "entscheidend" or "trägt das Argument", never
"load-bearing".

### 6b. Absolutes

`nobody` 25x, `nowhere` 20x, `nothing` 19x, `alone` 14x, `whoever` 13x, `forever` 13x, `somebody`
11x, `neither` 10x, `whichever` 10x.

Name the party instead. The absolute is a rhetorical move; the name is information.

- "Nobody owns the pipeline" -> "The pipeline has no owner" or name the team that should.
- "There is nowhere else for it to be" -> cut the sentence, the point was made.

### 6c. The abstraction that acts

An abstract noun as the subject of a verb only a person performs. `carries` 21x, `carrying` 20x,
`refuses` 23x, `rests` 17x, `refused` 17x, `carried` 16x, `admits` 16x, `holds` 15x, `settles`
14x, `says` 14x, `decides` 13x, `lands` 12x, `stands` 11x, `buys` 11x, `governs` 10x, `pays` 10x.

Put the person or the system back in the subject position.

- "The rule carries the consequence" -> "Whoever breaks the rule pays for it" or name the cost.
- "The contract holds" -> "The contract still applies."

### 6f. German drafts

The corpus is English, so the words above do not transfer and the classes do. Check a German draft
class by class: Haltungs-Adverbien (`schlicht`, `still`, `bewusst`, `nachweislich`), Absolutwörter
(`niemand`, `nirgends`, `nichts`), abstrakte Subjekte mit Personen-Verben ("die Regel trägt", "der
Vertrag entscheidet"), Gerichtsvokabular (`Anspruch`, `Präzedenzfall`, `Befund`, `Mangel`). Those
German examples are translations of the measured classes and are not themselves measured; the
density bar in 6 applies to them the same way.
