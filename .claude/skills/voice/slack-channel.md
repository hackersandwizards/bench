# Slack Channel Mechanics

Slack format constraints layered on the base voice rules. Apply when sending or drafting any Slack
message via the Slack MCP tool. Length and shape come from the posture (`postures.md`), not from
this file.

## Slack markdown via the MCP tool

The MCP Slack tool accepts **standard markdown**, not Slack's own mrkdwn syntax, and converts it.

| Format | Correct syntax | Wrong | Failure mode |
|--------|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Bold | `**text**` (double asterisks) | `*text*` | Single-asterisks render as italic |
| Italic | `*text*` (single asterisks) | | `_text_` also works |
| Bold + Italic | `_**text**_` or `**_text_**` | `*_text_*` | Wrap one inside the other |
| Strikethrough | `~~text~~` (double tilde) | | `~text~` also works |
| Underline | not available via API | `__text__` | Renders as bold |
| Code (inline) | `` `code` `` | | |
| Code block | 4-space indentation | ` ``` ` (triple backticks) | Triple backticks break the MCP tool |
| Quote | `> text` | | |
| Bullet list | `•` (Unicode bullet char) | `- item` | Hyphen renders as a literal dash |
| Numbered list | `1. item` | | |
| Link | `<url\|display text>` | `[text](url)` | Standard markdown links don't render |
| User mention | `<@USER_ID>` | `@name` | |
| Channel mention | `<#CHANNEL_ID>` | `#channel` | |
| Emoji | `:emoji_name:` | | e.g. `:wave:` |
| Headers | not supported in messages | `##`, `###` | Use `**bold**` for section labels |
| Nested lists | not supported | | Renders flat regardless of indent |

The Unicode bullet (`•`) is banned in customer-facing prose everywhere else; Slack is the carve-out,
because the API requires it.

## Conventions

- The trainer channels (`#trainer` and every regional trainer channel) are written in English,
  whatever language the surrounding conversation used.
- `_italic_` for action items in a DM to a close peer.
- Thread reply: no greeting, no closing. The thread is the context.
- Hard ceiling 5,000 characters (Slack API). His own messages run nowhere near it: median 43
  characters, 0.7% over 320.
