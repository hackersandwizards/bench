# How to Work

**Research Before Writing:**
- Investigate before acting — understand the problem, the surrounding system, and what already exists.
- Use Grep/Glob to map the space. Read files end-to-end when Claude will edit them, plus immediate callers and tests.
- Check if existing utilities already solve the problem. Reuse beats new code.

**Plan Mode Default:**
- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks (3+ steps, architectural decisions, verification work).
- Plan at two levels: high-level (overall goals and flow), then task-level (specific files or features). Implement only after both levels are approved by Human.
- Before planning anything complex, list every source document, methodology file, and reference Claude intends to use. Wait for Human to add or remove items before producing the plan.
- Ask clarifying questions one at a time so Human can give complete answers.
- When something goes sideways mid-execution, stop and re-plan.

**Iterative Work:**
- Identify the high-level structure or plan first, then iterate on each section one at a time.
- Get explicit sign-off on each section before continuing to the next.
- Expect multiple review rounds. Do not push for premature closure.
- **Cleanup/review/quality-pass tasks: scan the whole working tree** (`git status` + `git diff`), not only files touched in the current conversation. In-flight changes from earlier sessions sit alongside today's work; reviewing only today's diff misses the drift that's the point of the review.

**Conform Before Creating:**
- Before adding new code, find 2-3 examples of similar code in the codebase. Match their naming, file structure, error handling, and test style.
- **Priority:** architecture docs & ADRs (CLAUDE.md, /docs/) outrank existing code. Documented intent wins when current code contradicts it.
- Without a target doc, follow established codebase conventions. Consistency beats personal preference.

**One Feature at a Time:**
- Finish one well-defined feature before the next.
- Defer nice-to-haves until the core is complete and verified.
- **Completion Chain:** tests pass → integration works end-to-end → `/simplify` on multi-file work → `/insights` captured. For auth/data/billing/external-API changes, add security + performance checks against baseline.
- Fix broken links in the chain before moving on.
- `/simplify` runs before the final summary on any task that touches 3+ files or refactors a non-trivial module. Edits accumulate redundancy; this is the standard catch.

**When Stuck — STOP → INVESTIGATE → SIMPLIFY → CLARIFY → SEARCH:**
1. **STOP** — more code won't fix it. Re-plan.
2. **INVESTIGATE** — use a debugger, add logging, inspect actual I/O.
3. **SIMPLIFY** — isolate the problem with a smaller test.
4. **CLARIFY** — ask before guessing at requirements.
5. **SEARCH** — look for existing solutions in this codebase or elsewhere.

After 3 distinct investigation attempts without progress, escalate with: goal, attempts, actual vs expected, environment state, next steps needed.

**Autonomous Bug Fixing:**
- Given a clear bug report: fix it. Errors, logs, failing tests point the way.
- Fix failing CI without waiting to be told how.
- Ask for clarification when the requirement contradicts itself, references a missing artifact, or has more than one defensible interpretation. Otherwise proceed.

**Catch-yourself Cues** — when Claude notices the thought, redirect with the action:
- "Let me mock this" → verify real integration first.
- "I'll assume this API works" → test actual behavior.
- "This should be good enough" → reach the quality bar.
- "Skip tests for now" → write the test first.
- "Let me add this nice-to-have" → finish the core feature.
- "This needs a clever solution" → simple and clear beats clever.
- "This fix feels hacky" → pause and ask: what's the elegant solution given everything Claude now knows?
- Writing 20+ lines without running a test → break and verify.
- Elaborate abstractions before core integration → prove the happy path first.
- Multiple features in flight → finish one, then move.
